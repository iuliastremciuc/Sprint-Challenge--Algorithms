#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)


b) O(n log n)


c) O(n)

## Exercise II
1. find middle poin of list 
2. compare search key to the middle
3. if it will match and will stop farther iterations
3. repeat step 1, 2 on the left or right part of data if serach key less or more until serach key will find the match 

Time complexity is O(log n)
